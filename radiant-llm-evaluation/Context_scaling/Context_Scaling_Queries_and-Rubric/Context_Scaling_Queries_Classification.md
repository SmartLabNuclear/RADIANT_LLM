Benchmark Family: Context Expansion

## Standardized Metric Definitions

- Context Precision (CoP):
  $CoP_i = CoP_{N,i}$ if $CoP_{S,i}$ is undefined; $CoP_i = CoP_{S,i}$ if $CoP_{N,i}$ is undefined; otherwise $CoP_i = \alpha CoP_{S,i} + (1-\alpha) CoP_{N,i}$.
  - Constraint: $CoP_{S,i} \in \{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1\}$.

  | CoP_S score | Interpretation |
  | --- | --- |
  | 0 | incorrect |
  | 0.25 | minimally correct |
  | 0.5 | partially correct |
  | 0.75 | mostly correct |
  | 1 | fully correct |
- Citation Precision (CiP):
  $CiP_i = \frac{\text{number of valid citations in } C_i}{\max(|C_i|, 1)}$.
  - Note: A citation is valid when it identifies supporting evidence at the correct evidence item; for figure/table/section queries, exact page-string equality is not required if the document and figure/table/section identity are correct and unambiguous.
  - Constraint: $0 \le CiP_i \le 1$.

- Citation Hit (CiH):
  $CiH_i = 1$ if at least one citation in $C_i$ refers to a canonical evidence item in $E_i^*$ by evidence identity; else $0$.
  - Note: For figure/table/section queries, a correct evidence identifier counts as a hit even when the printed/software page locator is omitted or offset.
  - Constraint: $CiH_i \in \{0, 1\}$.

- Hallucination Rate (HR):
  $HR_i = \frac{|K_{unsupported}|}{|K_{generated}|}$.
  - Constraint: $0 \le HR_i \le 1$.

- Visual Recall (ViR):
  $ViR_i = \frac{|F_i \cap F_i^*|}{|F_i^*|}$.
  - Constraint: $0 \le ViR_i \le 1$.
