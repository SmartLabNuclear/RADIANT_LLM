## Standardized Metric Definitions

- Context Precision (CoP):
  $CoP_i = CoP_{N,i}$ if $CoP_{S,i}$ is undefined; $CoP_i = CoP_{S,i}$ if $CoP_{N,i}$ is undefined; otherwise $CoP_i = \alpha CoP_{S,i} + (1-\alpha) CoP_{N,i}$.
  - Constraint: $CoP_{S,i} \in \{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1\}$.

  | CoP_S score | Interpretation |
  | --- | --- |
  | 0 | incorrect |
  | 0.25 | minimally correct |
  | 0.5 | partially correct |
  | 0.75 | mostly correct |
  | 1 | fully correct |
- Citation Precision (CiP):
  $CiP_i = \frac{\text{number of valid citations in } C_i}{\max(|C_i|, 1)}$.
  - Note: A citation is valid when it identifies supporting evidence at the correct evidence item; for figure/table/section queries, exact page-string equality is not required if the document and figure/table/section identity are correct and unambiguous.
  - Constraint: $0 \le CiP_i \le 1$.

- Citation Hit (CiH):
  $CiH_i = 1$ if at least one citation in $C_i$ refers to a canonical evidence item in $E_i^*$ by evidence identity; else $0$.
  - Note: For figure/table/section queries, a correct evidence identifier counts as a hit even when the printed/software page locator is omitted or offset.
  - Constraint: $CiH_i \in \{0, 1\}$.

- Hallucination Rate (HR):
  $HR_i = \frac{|K_{unsupported}|}{|K_{generated}|}$.
  - Constraint: $0 \le HR_i \le 1$.

- Visual Recall (ViR):
  $ViR_i = \frac{|F_i \cap F_i^*|}{|F_i^*|}$.
  - Constraint: $0 \le ViR_i \le 1$.

### Notes
- Page-level benchmark scoring focuses on CoP, HR, and ViR; CiP/CiH are defined here for vocabulary consistency but are not averaged in the page-level summary tables.
- Citation strings are retained for provenance review, but exact page-string equality is not required when the evidence item is otherwise unambiguous.
- If a claim is both wrong and unsupported: it increases HR and decreases CoP.

The equation of the ellipse adjacent to Fig. 51 is given by:

x^2 / 64 + y^2 / 36 = 1.

This equation implies the following full coordinate extents for the ellipse:
The semi-major axis is along the x-axis with a length of 8, so the full extent along
the x-axis is from −8 to 8. The semi-minor axis is along the y-axis with a length of 6,
so the full extent along the y-axis is from −6 to 6.

### Q9
- Page ID: Todreas_and_Kazimi_p53.pdf:p1
- Query: What explanation does the text provide for the flattening of radial and axial power profiles in real reactors compared to the idealized profiles shown in Figure 3-3?
- Answer

```text
The text explains that in real reactors, the flattening of radial and axial
power profiles compared to the idealized profiles shown in Figure 3-3 is due
to the higher burnup of fuel at locations of high neutron fluxes. This effect
leads to a more uniform power distribution across the reactor core.

- Query: According to the text accompanying Fig. 3-7, what is the stated purpose of the thermal shield, and which physical damage mechanisms is it intended to mitigate?
- Answer

```text
The stated purpose of the thermal shield in a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)
is to protect the pressure vessel from γ-ray heating and neutron-induced
radiation damage. It mitigates physical damage mechanisms by reducing the heat
generation rate and radiation exposure to the pressure vessel, thereby
extending its operational life and ensuring safety.

- Query: How does the text use the geometry shown in Fig. 3-7 to simplify the power-deposition calculation, and what geometric assumption is explicitly stated?
- Answer

```text
The text uses the geometry shown in Fig. 3-7 to simplify the power-deposition
calculation by assuming that the thermal shield can be represented as a
cylindrical shell. The explicit geometric assumption stated is that the
thermal shield is modeled as a “thin cylindrical shell,” which allows for
simplification in calculating the power deposition by considering the geometry
as a series of concentric cylindrical surfaces.
